I can't say anything bad about this dress. It was gorgeous. The fabric was thick and excellent quality. The bow was my favorite part. I had to pin it up otherwise it flopped down but as mentioned previously the fabric was sturdy enough the safety pin did the trick! I would rent this again or buy it without hesitation! (My profile won't update but I am 136 lbs and the 2 was perfect!) I got so many compliments. It was exactly what I wanted. Sophisticated but so much fun! The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because it was a little worn.
"Overall I enjoyed the dress, however I did feel like it was quite long... especially in the front. I was anticipating a length about 3-4 inches above the knee, and the dress came to my knees. "
This is my favorite designer and love almost all of her dresses.  I love the fit and cut of this dress.  The black top w/spaghetti straps with the floral high low bottom was perfect!  I got multiple compliments on how beautiful the dress was.  I have a larger chest so the deep cut of the top was an issue for me in the size 4 so I did go up so that the 6 gave me just a little more coverage.  Didn't feel as though throughout there was that much of a difference in the sizes though.  I will definitely rent this dress again.
"I don't know if I have ever gotten more compliments on a top! The lace and ruffle are beautiful but not too much for the office. Will be renting this one again! But, be careful tall ladies, its cut a bit cropped so wear with high waisted pants or skirt."
This dress was amazing!!! It fit perfectly and was flirty and sexy. Would definitely wear it again!! 
"This was my second choice dress and I did not wear it. The dress fit well, but I had a 4R and would have had to wear flats.  A 4l might have been better.  "
"Great silhouette that is sexy but forgiving. Be warned - the v is definitely plunging and is lower cut than it looks in the picture, but the length of the dress and the nice, thick fabric keep it classy. I felt very elegant and got lots of compliments. "
"Wore it for work 2 days!  I loved it so much, perfect for summer, quality is awesome.  Fit was true to size"
"This navy dress was perfect for a spring wedding. It is a bit conservative but still felt special. It had a bit of a mod feel in the shape. It was a comfortable dress for dancing. I'm 5'2"" and this dress hit me at my knee. I would rent this again. 
A couple of things to keep in mind. I was a bit annoyed that I had to wear a strapless bra because of the cut around the armholes/straps but it worked out fine. I'm a 40DD and it was a little tight across the chest but it didn't bother me. I was bummed that my dress (and the backup size) didn't look exactly like the site photos. In the site photos there is no lining and you can see the thighs in the side lace panels - in the actual dresses (both the XL and the 1X) the lining came all the way to the bottom of the seam of the dress.  So no picaboo side panels -  the dress was bit more conservative than I had expected. "
"The white on the outfit wasn't crisp, it looked more eggshell. The size 6 was a little big in the bust, so I wore another dress. "
Love everything about this dress!
"The fit, fabric and color of this dress is terrific.  The fabric has some nice weight to it and it's got a bit of texture so you don't have to worry about wrinkles.  It's got pockets in the front!  Easy to wear.  Very flattering.  It's got a bit of stretch.  Great color and pattern.  Would definitely rent again!"
"I wore this gown for an Army holiday ball. RTR was very easy to use and I didn't have to worry about spending $300+ on a gown I would only wear once. The gown was a little loose in the bust and four inch heels will bring the gown just a bit from dragging the floor. A regular strapless bra works well, although no bra is needed. I loved this gown and recommend it to anybody!"
This looks gorgeous in person and is such an elegant and timeless piece. I got swarms of compliments on it from guys and gals alike so I think it was sexy without being too sultry. My only complaint is the pencil skirt does not allow a ton of movement so dancing was somewhat restricted. But I made it work! 
"The fit of this was very true to size, although the fabric is stretchy, so you can go smaller if you want it more hugging. It was a beautiful dress with great fabric - it has texture. It was long enough and with a high neck to offset how much it hugs the curves, so it still felt appropriate for a family wedding. I wore it with hair up and big gold earrings and loved the look! my only caution would be that if you plan to eat a big dinner, be prepared to suck it in all night - no forgiveness from this dress! "
"It fit perfectly! I could have worn the 4R but the lower back clasp was missing so I wore the 4L, which wasn't much longer than the 4R."
"The dress fit perfectly around my hips. I normally wear a 6 but I needed an 8 in this one. I new about the size difference before ordering because I read the prior reviews. I was a little nervous about the cross over, I'm a D cup and was self conscious about appearing slutry. Once the dressed arrived I realized it did a perfect job at covering and securing my chest area. This dress is a match between sexy and chic. I loved it "
I wore this dress for the Carolina Cup - a derby race in SC. This dress was perfect and I received so many compliments. The weather starting off storming which led to the grounds being muddy and me having to wear my wellies. The fit of this dress was spot on. I wear a true 0 and didn't have any problem with the fit. The back is unique (although it left me with a funky tan line!) -- I love anything with pockets so I was immediately sold! This dress was a perfect weight for an outdoor event and would be perfect for a spring/summer wedding as well. I would definitely rent this dress again if I had another event.
"Favorite leather jacket! Both the brown coloring and collared neckline are so flattering. The overall structure and detailing also compliment the jacket in itself. Running true to size and with no stretch in the fabric, we recommend sizing up for backup. Pair with black tight top and dark high wasted jeans."
"This dress was amazing; however, like most reviews stated the length of the dress was short. I rented a 0R ( the long was not available), and a 2L for the back up. I ultimately wore the 2L because the length was just the way I wanted it. If you are small bust like myself, the size 2 may fit a little loose. "
