Discussed the assignment with 
- Aman Gupta 2019CS10673

- Model used LogisticRegression(C=1, class_weight='balanced', solver='liblinear', multi_class='ovr', max_iter = 1000, verbose=False)

- For preprocessing, used Lemmatization and Stopwords Removal. Stemming did not increase the accuracy.
- Used Bigrams, gave better accuracy than unigrams and trigrams.
